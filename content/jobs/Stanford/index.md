- As part of the 17th Cohort, we conducted professional research at Stanford, specifically my research was within the Human-Computer Interaction Department.
- I enhanced the protocol of the Creative Drive Project, and we were able to run a pilot study.
- In addition, with this fellowship, our Cohort did a GRE Prep Course, Mentorship, Company visits within Silicon Valley, and Professional Development Workshops.
