Howdy! I'm Kordell, a software engineer based in Tama, IA who enjoys building anything that lives on the internet. I previously have done professional research and my main interests are Blockchain Technology, Data Science, and Autonomous Robotics.

I currently attend [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/), I joined [STEM Scholars](https://stem.las.iastate.edu/) Fall of 2018 where we work on diversifying STEM. In addition, STEM Scholars seeks to develop leaders, creative problem solvers, and innovators.
