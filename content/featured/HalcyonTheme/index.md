This app will give you the latest Bitcoin prices in all the popular, traded currencies, so you can track how well your Bitcoin investments are doing on the go. [BitcoinAverage API](https://apiv2.bitcoinaverage.com/) is where the JSON data is grabbed from. Another good API for current Bitcoin prices is [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/#section/Quick-Start-Guide).
