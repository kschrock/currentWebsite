This research project looked into how creativity is affected whether being a driver or a passenger in a car-simulator. Our pilot-study evaluated the participant's creativity through a creativity assessment Before, During, and After the study.[Stanford's Human-Computer Interaction Research Group](https://hci.stanford.edu/research/).
